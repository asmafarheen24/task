    <p>E-learning is a structured course or learning experience delivered electronically; it can also include performance support content. There are also many different elements that can make up an e-learning program, such as live or pre-recorded lecture content, video, quizzes, simulations, games, activities, and other interactive elements.

        Keep in mind that you may also see the term e-learning more broadly as a catchall for any learning content delivered electronically. While ATD style uses a hyphen in the spelling, you may also see it spelled elearning or eLearning. E-learning courses are typically managed and administered via a learning management system (LMS). As author, Steven D. Foreman notes in his book, The LMS Guidebook, an learning management system is "a multiuser software application, usually accessed through a web browser. </p>
